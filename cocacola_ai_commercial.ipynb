        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   A total of 2005 comments were analyzed for sentiment.\n",
        "*   The sentiment distribution of the YouTube comments is as follows:\n",
        "    *   Negative: 63.99%\n",
        "    *   Neutral: 22.99%\n",

        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The high proportion of negative comments suggests potential issues or strong dissatisfaction among viewers regarding the video's content, topic, or related context. Further qualitative analysis of these negative comments could pinpoint specific areas of concern.\n",
        "*   Consider exploring the content of the negative comments to identify common themes or keywords that might explain the overwhelmingly negative sentiment. This could inform future content strategies or address community concerns.\n"
